# Hello there, my name is Christian Barra!
I am a (__freelance developer__ &#8746; __consultant__ &#8746; __trainer__) &#8745; __Python__.

I am board member of the [EuroPython Society](http://www.europython-society.org/about) from 2016 and organizer of the [EuroPython Conference](https://www.europython.eu) from 2015.

Currently I live in Wroc≈Çaw (Poland) where I run the [PyData Wroclaw Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Wroclaw/) and lead the [Microbit:Polska](https://www.microbitpolska.org) project.

I spend my days coding and try to get (ideally) 1% better every day, most of the time I fail but is a part of the process.

Beside being a freelancer I am working on a personal project called [Cassiny.io](https://www.cassiny.io) and helping maintaining the [aiodocker](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiodocker) library.


## Have some cool stuff to work on? I'll be happy to know more: me [//at//] chrisbarra [//dot//] xyz
