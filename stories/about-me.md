# Hello there, my name is Christian Barra!
I am a (__freelance developer__ &#8746; __consultant__ &#8746; __trainer__) &#8745; __Python__.

<p>From 2016 I am board member of the <a href="http://www.europython-society.org">EuroPython Society</a> and organizer of <a href="https://www.europython.eu">EuroPython Conference</a> from 2015.</p>

<p>I love coding and tech, in my spare time I enjoy studying stats and improve my coding and soft skills.</p>

Currently I live in Wroc≈Çaw (Poland) where I run the [PyData Wroclaw Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Wroclaw/) and lead the [Microbit:Polska](https://www.microbitpolska.org) project.

Beside being a freelancer I am working on a personal project called [Cassiny.io](https://www.cassiny.io) and helping maintaining the [aiodocker](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiodocker) library.
