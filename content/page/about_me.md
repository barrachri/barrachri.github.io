![Christian Barra](/images/me.jpeg "Christian Barra")


Hi there! My name is Christian and I like to build things and share my knowledge.

In the last years I worked as a consultant, software developer and data scientist.

I am a proud Pythonista, [PSF Fellow](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/06/ "Python Fellow") and I spent a big part of the last 5 years growing the Python Community in Europe. I have been a board member of the [EuroPython Society](http://www.europython-society.org/about "EuroPython Society"), core organizer of 4 editions of the  [EuroPython Conference](https://www.europython.eu "EuroPython Conference") and conference chair of [EuroPython 2017](https://ep2017.europython.eu/ "EuroPython 2017").

Lately I started to be involved with the organization of [PyCon DE](https://de.pycon.org "PyCon DE").

I often give presentations about different topics and you can find them on:

- [speaker deck](https://speakerdeck.com/barrachri "Christian Barra speaker deck")
- [talks repository](https://github.com/barrachri/Talks "Christian Barra github account")
- just look on YouTube.

I have a lot of fun writing software and contributing to open source projects (check my [github account](https://github.com/barrachri "barrachri github account") if you want to know more).

Currently I am focusing on these areas:

- Machine/Statistical learning
- Data engineering
- Event-driven architecture using Python/Go

### Remote

I am big advocate of the distributed and remote culture.
Starting from 2013 I have been working remotely, giving me a great chance to meet amazing people and explore the 🌍.

These are the places where I have been so far:

- 🇬🇧 🇮🇪 🇫🇷 🇪🇪 🇪🇸 🇵🇹 🇵🇱 🇧🇪 🇮🇸 🇩🇪 🇦🇹 🇨🇿 🇸🇰 🇷🇴 🇧🇬 🇭🇺 🇳🇴 🇸🇲 🇻🇦 🇹🇷
- 🇰🇷 🇯🇵 🇹🇭 🇱🇦
- 🇺🇸
- 🇶🇦
- 🇹🇳 🇲🇦

I am often around Europe, either for conferences or to escape the winter, so follow me on Twitter to find when I am in your city and we can meet up (I am serious about this!)

### Teaching

Sharing your knowledge in an effective way, teaching people, mentor them correctly is a complex mix between science and art.

And if you wonder where you can find the best practices my answer is:
[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/ "Software Carpentry") and [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/ "Data Carpentry").

This is why I decided to become a certified instructor.

### My (side) projects

I am currently working on 2 side projects:

- **[cassiny.io](https://www.cassiny.io)**: data related
- **[pybootcamp.com](https://www.pybootcamp.com)**: teaching related

They are definitively work in progress and they need more attention.
