![Christian Barra](/images/me_bw.jpg "Christian Barra")

Hi there! My name is Christian and **I like to build things and share my knowledge**.

I' am Senior Software Engineer based in Berlin with a particular focus on

- Machine/Statistical learning
- Data engineering
- Microservices and event-driven architecture

I am a proud [Pythonista](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Pythonista "Pythonista") and [Python Software Foundation Fellow](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/06/ "Python Fellow").

A big part of my last 5 years were dedicated to growing the Python Community in Europe.

I have been a board member of the [EuroPython Society](http://www.europython-society.org/about "EuroPython Society"), core organizer of 4 editions of the [EuroPython Conference](https://www.europython.eu "EuroPython Conference") and conference chair of [EuroPython 2017](https://ep2017.europython.eu/ "EuroPython 2017").

I often give presentations at conferences or meetups and you can find them on:

- [my speaker deck](https://speakerdeck.com/barrachri "Christian Barra speaker deck")
- [my talks repository](https://github.com/barrachri/Talks "Christian Barra github account")
- or just look on YouTube.

I am currently organizing [PyCon DE 2019](https://de.pycon.org/ "PyCon DE 2019"), that will take place in Berlin, and [https://berlin.python.pizza/](https://berlin.python.pizza/ "Berlin Python Pizza").

I am often around Europe, for conferences or to escape the winter, so follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/christianbarra "@christianbarra") to find when I am in your city and we can meet up (I am serious about this!)
