### Hi there! I am Christian

I'm originally from ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹ and currently living in Berlin (ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª) where I work remotely for [made.com](https://www.made.com) (ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§).

I like to organize Python things:

- Board member of the [EuroPython Society](http://www.europython-society.org/about "EuroPython Society") (2016-current)
- Organizer of the [EuroPython Conference](https://www.europython.eu "EuroPython Conference") (2015-current)
- Organizer of [PyData WrocÅ‚aw](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Wroclaw/ "PyData WrocÅ‚aw meetup") (2016-2017)
- Founder of [Microbit:Polska](https://microbitpolska.org/ "Microbit:Polska project") (2016-2017)

and contribute to open source projects (check my [github account](https://github.com/barrachri "Christian Barra github account") if you want to know more).

I often give presentations about different topics and you can find them on:

- [speaker deck](https://speakerdeck.com/barrachri "Christian Barra speaker deck")
- [talks repository](https://github.com/barrachri/Talks "Christian Barra github account")
- just look on YouTube.

### My side projects

I am currently working on 2 side projects:

- **[cassiny.io](https://www.cassiny.io "Cassiny.io: a data platform")**: a data platform to make really easy to collect and work with data
- **[pybootcamp.com](https://www.pybootcamp.com "PyBootCamp: A pythonic weekly screencast series")**: a Pythonic weekly screencast series

### Where I am investing a big part of my time

that means reading/learning/doing/experimenting with:

- Machine/Statistical learning
- Data engineering
- Event-driven architecture using Python/Go

### And besides that?

**_I definitively like to travel and do bouldering_**.

These are the places where I have been so far:
