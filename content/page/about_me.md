Hi there!

My name is Christian and I am Senior Software Engineer based in Berlin where and I am organizing [PyCon DE 2019](https://de.pycon.org/ "PyCon DE 2019") and [berlin.python.pizza](https://berlin.python.pizza/ "Berlin Python Pizza").

My focus is currently on:

- Microservices and event-driven architecture
- Machine/Statistical learning
- DevOps for microservices and machine learning
- Data engineering

I am a proud [Pythonista](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Pythonista "Pythonista") and [Python Software Foundation Fellow](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/06/ "Python Fellow").

I was a board member of the [EuroPython Society](http://www.europython-society.org/about "EuroPython Society"), core organizer of 4 editions of the [EuroPython Conference](https://www.europython.eu "EuroPython Conference") and conference chair of [EuroPython 2017](https://ep2017.europython.eu/ "EuroPython 2017").
