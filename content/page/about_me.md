Hi there!

My name is Christian Barra, I am a Senior Software Engineer based in Berlin where I am organizing a couple of things related to Python:

- [PyCon DE & PyData Berlin 2019](https://de.pycon.org/ "PyCon DE & PyData Berlin 2019")
- [PyBerlin meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ "PyBerlin")
- [berlin.python.pizza](https://berlin.python.pizza/ "Berlin Python Pizza").

> Looking for a consultant or you want to have a course about Python?
> I'll be happy to have a chat about it :)

My focus is currently on:

- Microservices and event-driven architecture
- Machine/Statistical learning
- DevOps for microservices and machine learning
- Data engineering

I am a proud [Pythonista](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Pythonista "Pythonista") and [Python Software Foundation Fellow](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/06/ "Python Fellow").

During the 2015-2018 period I had the opportunity the help the Python Community in Europe as a board member of the [EuroPython Society](http://www.europython-society.org/about "EuroPython Society"), core organizer of 4 editions of the [EuroPython Conference](https://www.europython.eu "EuroPython Conference") and conference chair of [EuroPython 2017](https://ep2017.europython.eu/ "EuroPython 2017").
