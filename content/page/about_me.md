![Christian Barra](/images/me_bw.jpg "Christian Barra")

Hi there! My name is Christian and **I like to build things and share my knowledge**.

In the last years I worked as a consultant, software developer and data scientist focusing on:

- Machine/Statistical learning
- Data engineering
- Event-driven architecture using Python/Go
- Open Source

I am a proud [Pythonista](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Pythonista "Pythonista") and [Python Software Foundation Fellow](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/06/ "Python Fellow").

A big part of my last 5 years were dedicated to growing the Python Community in Europe.

I have been a board member of the [EuroPython Society](http://www.europython-society.org/about "EuroPython Society"), core organizer of 4 editions of the [EuroPython Conference](https://www.europython.eu "EuroPython Conference") and conference chair of [EuroPython 2017](https://ep2017.europython.eu/ "EuroPython 2017").

I often give presentations at conferences or meetups and you can find them on:

- [my speaker deck](https://speakerdeck.com/barrachri "Christian Barra speaker deck")
- [my talks repository](https://github.com/barrachri/Talks "Christian Barra github account")
- or just look on YouTube.

I am big advocate of the distributed and remote culture. Since 2013 I have been working, more or less, remotely -- with the big pros of meeting amazing people and explore the üåç.

I am often around Europe, for conferences or to escape the winter, so follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/christianbarra "@christianbarra") to find when I am in your city and we can meet up (I am serious about this!)

### My (side) projects

I am currently working on 2 side projects:

- **[cassiny.io](https://www.cassiny.io)**: data related
- **[pybootcamp.com](https://www.pybootcamp.com)**: teaching related

They are in a constant work in progress state and they need more attention.
