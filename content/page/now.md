I am living in Berlin (Germany) and although is a crazy city I really, really like it.

The long term plan is to spend 8-9 months here and escape the winter in a warmer place, somewhere in Southern Europe.

One of the main reasons to settle down in Berlin was to have more focused time and have less moving around hustle.

I have 3 main areas of focus (yes...they are interrelated):

    - Polyniq
    - Python
    - Skills

### Polyniq

[Polyniq](https://www.polyniq.com) (polynomial uniqueness) is SaaS I am working on, with the goal of providing recommendation and personalisation of contents/products and more generally of the user experience.

### Python

I am really keen in fostering the Python community here in Berlin, in 2 ways:

- being an active member of the local community
- organising [berlin.python.pizza](https://berlin.python.pizza) and [PyCon DE 2019](https://2019.pycon.de/)

I really like to imagine Berlin as one of the main Python hubs in Europe (community and jobs wise) in the next years....this is why I wanted to bring [PyCon DE 2019](https://2019.pycon.de/) here.

### Skills

- Improve my skills as Tech Lead and Architect
- Get a better understanding of how you can create a great tech team
- Devops practices and production readiness
- The 3 things above with a particular focus on data science
- Learn typescript and Go
