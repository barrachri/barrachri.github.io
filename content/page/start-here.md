Hi there, I am Christian ðŸ‘‹

I used to hack video game consoles to make money during my teenage-hood, then I dropped out of the Catholic University of Milan to start a company about renewable energies.

Fast forward a few years I am now a Senior Software Engineer, Tech Lead and speaker living in Berlin where I work four days a week at [infarm](https://www.infarm.com).

I read, talk, blog and tweet about:

- AI and IoT systems
- DevOps culture and practices
- Leadership & Culture inside Tech
- Tech for Good
- Remote work

After moving to Berlin in 2018 I have organized multiple events related to Python like [PyCon DE & PyData Berlin 2019](https://de.pycon.org/ "PyCon DE & PyData Berlin 2019") and [berlin.python.pizza](https://2019.berlin.python.pizza "Berlin Python Pizza").

In the past I had the opportunity to help the Python Community in Europe as a board member of the [EuroPython Society](http://www.europython-society.org/about "EuroPython Society"), core organizer of 4 editions of the [EuroPython Conference](https://www.europython.eu "EuroPython Conference") and conference chair of [EuroPython 2017](https://ep2017.europython.eu/ "EuroPython 2017").

I am a [Python Software Foundation Fellow](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/06/ "Python Fellow").

Online you can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/christianbarra), [github](https://github.com/barrachri/), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christianbarra/) and you can send me an email at `me [AT] christianbarra [DOT] com`.
