Hi there, I am Christian ðŸ‘‹

I used to hack video game consoles to make money during my teenage-hood, then after I dropped out of university I started a company about renewable energies.

Fast forward a few years I am now a senior software engineer and tech lead living in Berlin where I work at [infarm](https://www.infarm.com), the farming as a service company.

Topics I am really into (AKA I read, talk, blog and tweet about):

- AI, IoT and DevOps
- System Design
- Escaping 9-to-5 & remote work
- Tech for Good

I am a proactive member in the tech community, through contributions to [OSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software), coaching, speaking, writing and organising events.

I organized more than 20 events in the last years, ranging from meetups to +1000 people conferences like [EuroPython](https://www.europython.eu "EuroPython Conference") and [PyCon DE & PyData Berlin](https://de.pycon.org/ "PyCon DE & PyData Berlin 2019").

I am a [Python Software Foundation Fellow](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/06/ "Python Fellow") and former board member of the [EuroPython Society](http://www.europython-society.org/about "EuroPython Society").

Online you can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/christianbarra), [github](https://github.com/barrachri/), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christianbarra/) and you can send me an email at `me [AT] christianbarra [DOT] com`.
