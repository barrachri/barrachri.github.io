Some months ago I decided to run an experiment:

> move from an almost nomadic life and remote job to live in one place and commute every day to the office.

One of the main differences I have noticed between working remotely (whether home office or remote) and going every day to the office is the feeling of **owning your time**.

Your time is constantly stolen by commuting, inefficiencies, time with colleagues, lunches and meetings.

Although I work more or less the same hours I feel having much less time and energy for me.

51 minutes and 41 seconds is the time it takes me to go from my apartment’s door to my office’s door.

1 hour and 44 minutes every day, 8 hours and 40 minutes every week are lost.

I have never thought about it in this way but it looks like a compounding debt... that is increasing every day.

Yep... so far commuting has been something that *I did not enjoy*.
