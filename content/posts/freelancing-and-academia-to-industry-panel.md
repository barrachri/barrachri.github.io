On October 11th we hosted a [panel at PyConDE](https://de.pycon.org/program/pyconde-meegjc-job-panel-christian-barra-tereza-iofciu-katharina-rasch-matteo-guzzo-sieer-angar/) with [Matteo Guzzo](https://twitter.com/_teoguso), [Tereza Iofciu](https://twitter.com/terezaif), [Katharina Rasch](https://twitter.com/krasch_io) and [Sieer Angar](https://twitter.com/sieer83/) and I had the pleasure to be the moderator.

These are some of the takeaways:

### From Academia to Industry

> 1) **As a PhD student you learn how to learn**

This will be extremely useful to help you moving to industry and to learn new skills as fast as possible.

> 2) **Do your homework, be prepared**

If you don't want to be perceived as a junior during your interviews prepare yourself beforehand, try to understand what companies are looking for and how to approach the interview correctly.
If the interview process is something new for you have some dry runs with companies you don't want to work for.

> 3) **There are pros and cons on both worlds**

[Katharina Rasch](https://twitter.com/krasch_io) keeps teaching although working as a freelancer and consultant.
You can move to industry without fully leaving academia.

### Freelancing

> 1) **Wanna be a freelancer? Just do it**

If you think you want to do it just do it, you always have a rollback plan: finding another job as employee.

> 2) **You have to create and grow your network**

Meetups, conferences and generally sharing your knowledge is a great way to do it, make yourself visible.

> 3) **Freelancing platforms can be a great way to start**

Pivigo, Fiverr, Toptotal, Upwork are a great way to kick-start your way to freelancing.

> 4) **Create a cash buffer**

Having a cash buffer is fundamental if you want to be able to sustain your first months as a freelancer, that will give you financial freedom and reduce stress.

> 5) **You rates will suck at the beginning**

And that's fine. But don't forget to raise them and keep them updated considerinng market rates.

> 6) **Berlin is a bubble**

While knowing German might not be a requirement in Berlin the rest of Germany is different although things are changing.

> 7) **Just freely approach companies**

If you want to collaborate with them and/or create new connections as a freelancer.

> 8) **Take care of the bureaucratic stuff**

Being a freelancer involves some bureaucratic burdens you have to take care like accounting and health insurance.
