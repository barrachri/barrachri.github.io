During this past summer I negotiated new contract conditions, just before the end of my probation period:

**moving from full time (5 days) to a 3-day workweek while keeping the same salary**.

It took about 2 months but at the end we settled on a 4-day week deal.

But first, *how many days do we work*?

**If you open your agenda, and you work 5 days a week, you will find that around 221 days are already booked for something.**

221 days is the number of working days for an employee of a Berlin based company after you remove vacation days ([251 days/year](https://www.arbeitstage.de/EN/arbeitstage_2019.htm) minus 30 days of vacations, in my case).

Translated in a percentage is about **60.54% of the year**, which is quite a lot.

# What a 4-day workweek means

A 4-day workweek turns out to be about 200 working days, **~51 days** less than working full time, 1 month and 21 days more just for you.

To complete the count I can remove from the 200 days my vacations, and I get 170 days, ~46.5%  of the year.

**I can hardly describe the nice feeling of getting the ownership of the majority of your time back**.

# What I plan to do with those 51 days

Good question.

**I plan to leverage those days to get closer to the life I want to have, spending more time on the things that I like and less on the things that I don't**.

Combined with the fact that PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2019 is over I now have tons of free time.

So what am I up to?

- launching a training/consulting business with a focus on devops/infrastructure
- spending part of the winter away from Berlin
- learning new stuff
- running a couple of customer development interviews to create a SaaS business

My master plan is, by the end of 2020, to run a business between 5K € and 30K € in MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) without getting crazy (like the amazing founders of [HoneyBadger](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/122-josh-wood-of-honeybadger
)).

# Ok, stop rambling, how do I get a 4-day workweek deal?

So time for serious stuff!

First, having a 4-day workweek is much more common than what you probably think.

To be honest there are different ways:

- Negotiating a new deal with your employer
- Trainings/freelancing/consulting
- Running your own company
- ...

I'll cover `negotiating a new deal with your employer` in one of my next blog posts.

**tl;dr having the right mindset and approaching the negotiation from the right perspective are both crucial**.

In the meantime you can check my [tweets](https://twitter.com/christianbarra), I try to put some valuable thoughts and advice there.
