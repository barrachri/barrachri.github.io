Hiring a new member for a tech team is such a long process that as soon as the contract is signed you would like to think that your job is done.

But is it?

> No exactly, your hiring process is not yet done, the hardest part has still to be completed, **the onboarding**.

## What is the onboarding?

Wikipedia defines onboarding like

> the mechanism through which new employees acquire the necessary knowledge, skills, and behaviors in order to become effective organizational members and insiders

So **knowledge**, **skills** and **behaviors**.

## Why do you need it?

You spent around a month, during a long (and maybe painful) process, aren't we done? why spending more time?

- You want the new team member to be productive as soon as possible and make they happy will probably increase the productiveness and the chances that they will stay for a longer time.

- First impression matters, this is why the onboarding is fundamental.

- Give your new employees an amazing experience is generally better than providing an average or bad experience, so why wondering at all?

__And above all it will show that they are important__.

So how do you provide a great onboarding experience? **You need a plan and a goal**.

**The on boarding process needs to have a goal, something that is easy to measure or consider done (creating a PR, merging some code, release something to production....).**

## How to create a great plan

You need someone in charge of the process, a lead, senior engineer for example, someone that could guide the new hire, we will call it buddy.

It doesn't have to spend 24 hours with they but he/she should be generally available and responsible for the entire process and should be her/his main point of contact for any question related to the on-boarding process and its goals.

So the PIPitRight Team just hired a new awesome member Matteo, and the buddy for him is a Senior Backend Developer member of the same team called Luzia.

The goal is to fix an unclosed socket error, a bug that is afflicting a production service and to release the fix to prod.

## An ideal plan

An ideal plan is divided into 4 phases (at least):

1. Before the first day
2. During the first day
3. During the first weeks
4. Follow up

This article will cover the `Before the first day` and in the next weeks I will cover the remaining phases.

## Before the first day

There are a couple of things you need to prepare before she/he joins:

1. Internally share that a new hire will join the team
2. Prepp all the accounts/services he/she needs
3. Share the onboarding plan with the new hire

### 1. Share with the rest of the team who is joining and a brief bio

This sounds super easy but is easily forgotten or underlooked, especially if you are a remote team.

> There's nothing worse than having new people joining your team and you have no clue who is the new name inside slack channels.

I personally find really important (and often disturbing when it doesn't happen) that new hire is not introduced properly.

The buddy (a team lead/ engineering manager is also ok!) should introduce the new hire with an email or a message on slack for example.

```
Hello PIPitRight Team!

I am really happy to announce that in the next weeks Matteo will join our team as a Backend Developer.

He is been a ..... (short bio).

He will join the team on .../.../...

Looking forward to working together!

Best,
Luzia
```

It takes less than 5 minutes, just do it.

### Accounts are ready

Provide him/her with the accounts he/she needs email, github, slack, aws, gcp, heroku and all the related services, a nice wiki about how to obtain them is awesome, especially if there are external teams involved (security, ops...).

In many companies is just a matter of creating a new ticket/task.

### Having milestones and a task list for each day

Sharing the onboarding plan beforehand is extremely useful and doesn't require too much time:

```
Hi Matteo,

I am really happy you will join Z and PIPitRight team!

I am Luzia and I will be your buddy for the first 2 weeks.

We will pair together a couple of times during these weeks and I will introduce you through our tasks system and we will move a couple of tickets together from the backlog to done.

The goal for the 2 weeks is to fix an unclosed socket error, a bug that is afflicting a production service and to release the fix to prod. (ISSUE #4343).

It's going to be a lot of fun, can't wait for that!

Best,
Luzia
```

My appraoch is to avoid overwhelming a new hire and properly manage the cognitive load, with a small and focused scope that would increase during time.

For example having a 360 degrees and deep overview of the tech stack and infrastructure of the Z company is probably useless and a waste of time at the beginning.

Try to divide the learning process in small chunks, personally if it's not really needed to  achieve the goal/s, it could probably wait, understanding the entire architecture of your system is not really important at this stage.

This was everything I had for the `Before the first day`.

I am really looking forward to knowing how your onboarding process looks like, feel free to comment here or tweet me @christianbarra.
