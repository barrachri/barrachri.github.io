> You just hired a new member for your tech team.
>
> What's now?

You give them a new laptop, add their github account to your company users and says weclome onboard!

WRONG!!!

Your hiring process is not yet done, the hardest part has still to be completed, **the onboarding**.

## What is the onboarding?

From wikipedia

> refers to the mechanism through which new employees acquire the necessary knowledge, skills, and behaviors in order to become effective organizational members and insiders

## Why do you need it?

You spent a ~month, during a long recruiting process, aren't we done? why spending more time?

### Short answer

Because you don't want to waste the time you already spent, in fact you want to do your best to provide an amazing experience and keep the new hire happy.

### Long answer

First impression matters, this is why the onboarding is fundamental.
You want the new member to be productive as soon as possible and make they happy will probably increase the productiveness and the chances that they will stay for a longer time.

And give your new emploeyess an amazing experience is genereally better thatn providing them an average or bad experience.

And above all it will show that they are important.

So how dow you provide a great onboarding experience? You need a plan.

**The on boarding process needs to have a goal, something that is easy to measure or consider done (creating a PR, merging some code, release something to production....).**

### How to create a great plan

You need someone in charge of the process, a lead, senior engineer, someone that could guide the new hire, we will call it supervisor.

It doensn't have to spend 24 hours with they but it should be generally available and responsible for the entire process.

## An ideal plan

## Before during the first day

### 1. Share with the rest of the team who is joining and a brief bio

This sounds super easy but is easily forgotten or underlooked, especially if you are a remote temam.

> There's nothing worse than having new people joining your team and you have no clue who is the new name inside slack.

I personally find really important to get to know who you ar going to work with and the new mates.

The supervisor should introduct the new hire with an email or a message on slack for example.

It takes less than 5 minutes, just do it.

### Accounts and computer are ready

Email, github, slack, aws and all the related services, a nice wiki about how to obtain them is awesome.

Leaving the editor outside, is there are th8ngs needed like wpn client they should be thre already or you should an oboarding page where is described what you need to do and a contact in case you need help.

The support is really important :)

### Having milestones and a task list for each day

Nothing overwhelming, with a small scope that would increase during time.

For example having a 360 and deep overview of the tech stack and infrastructure is probably useless.

Try to divid the learning process in small chncks, personally if i dont really need it, it could probably wait.

Try not to overwhelm them, understanding the entire architecture of your system is not really important at this stage.

### Feedback

Usually you supervisor should get a feedback about the process:

* after the first day
* at the end of the first week
* at the end of the second week

Would be nice if the HR and the Developers Manager could follow up as well, usally after the first or second month, to check if everything is going as planned.

You can also extend it with forms, which will make the provided feedback more comparable.

Having HR and the developers inside the loop is important in case something between the supervisor/hire didn't work properly.
