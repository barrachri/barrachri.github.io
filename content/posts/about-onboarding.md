1. Why you need to care about on-boarding
2.

In a fast-paced and ever-changing environment like Booking.com, it’s crucial to make sure new employees are onboarded in the right way. That becomes even more vital in Tech, our fastest hiring department. With offices around the world, how do we create an effective onboarding programme that helps each new hire do their best work?

To find out how it’s done, we sat down with Martin Wanders, the Talent Development Coordinator who looks after onboarding for Technology and Agata Malczewska, an IT Coordinator who supports the entire department with logistics for new hire trainings. Here’s what they had to say:


Make new hires feel welcome.

Many tech professionals have relocated from other parts of the world. Booking.com wants to make sure that they can smoothly adjust to both the company culture and their new city. That’s why we have a three-day onboarding programme.

During this session, new hires are welcomed for three days of introductions and information sessions – giving them a chance to ask questions, connect with colleagues, and build relationships with other new hires. As Martin explains, “It’s important for new hires to be supported in order for them to settle in smoothly”.


Try not to overwhelm them.

Agata feels that this initial session is especially important in Tech because of the sheer size of the department. “Since Amsterdam offices can be overwhelming, we are also trying to show our new hires that it’s not as scary as it looks”, she explains.

The value of this initial programme is that all new hires can come together in one place, to easily digest information and ask questions. This means that their first focus can be on learning about the company in general – Booking.com’s values, vision, and more – and only later, get into the details of their specific role.


Integrate them with other tech professionals.

Once the 3-Day Onboarding Programme is completed, many of our Tech new hires join the Onboarding Track. This is a section of the Tech department made up exclusively of teams of new hires. Each team has a dedicated Onboarding Lead with lots of experience in getting new colleagues up to speed. This person leads each new hire on their ‘Learning Journey’, an eight-week training plan that equips them with all the skills and business knowledge they’ll need to successfully join any team in the department.

Why is this two-month training so important? Martin explains: “We want all new hires to feel comfortable, confident and ready for their new adventure. By the end of the programme they’ve learned about the various departments in Booking, and understood the business – how it works, why it works and what the key challenges are.”


Listen to feedback and be ready to make adjustments.

While both Agata and Martin agree that Booking.com’s Onboarding Programme has grown enormously in the past years, they’re always looking for ways to make it even better. As Martin says, “It’s very hard to predict what’s going to happen with this programme because of the fast-changing environment. We constantly make changes to each session after evaluating the feedback from the new hires, presenters and facilitators.”

At the moment, Booking.com is hiring a variety of tech roles in Amsterdam, Tel Aviv and Shanghai  – all very diverse markets with different challenges and needs. That means it’s more important than ever to have a dynamic onboarding process, one which takes into account the logistical challenges of remote offices. Unsurprisingly, this might mean that technological advancements play an even bigger role in tech onboarding soon. “I imagine in the future we’d use a lot more visuals and maybe even VR glasses so that everyone can join our onboarding in their own office”, Martin envisions.

So you just hired anew dev, whats now?

You give a new laptop, add his or her github account to your company users and says weclome onboard!

WRONG!!!

You hiring process is not yet done, thenhardest pat has still to be complet3d, the onboarding .


Why do you need it?
You probably have spent a month, during a 4 process steps, why spending more time?

Short answer: you want to make the previous time worth it
long answer
First impress matter, this is why the onboarding is fundamental
You want him/her to be to be productive as soon as possible
Make him/her happy will probably increase the productivenes and the chances that she he will stati for a longe 5ime

Given your new emploeyess an amazing experience is genereally better thatn providing them an average or bad experience.

And above all it will show that him/her is important.

Before starting, you need a plan.

The on boarding process needs to have a goal, hopefully something that is easy to measure or decide, like yo accomplished something or not.

Some examples


You need someone in charge of the process, a lead, senior software energine, someone that could guide him/her.

It doesnt have to spend 24 hours qwith hm but it should be generally avaible and responsible for the entire process.

On boarding process

Before during the first day

# share with the rest of the team who is joining and a brief bio
Th sounds supe easy but is easily forgotten.
There s nothing worse than having new people joining your team and you have no idea who is the name inside slack.

This is even more true when you have remote mqemebers.

Easy solution


Then person in charg will introdcue him her using an email or with a message inside slakc (can be a specific channel or the team one)

I find really important to get to know who you ar going to work with and the new mates.

There a milestone task list for each day
Nothing overwhelming, with a small scope that would increase during time.

For example having a 360 and deep overview of the tech stack and infrastructure is probably useless.

Try to divid the learning process in small chncks, personally if i dont really need it, it could probably wait.

# accounts

Email, github, slack, aws and all the related services.

Hopefully you use a 2fa throught an oauth provider, so you have to worry about one account only.


# the computer is ready

Leaving the editor outside, is there are th8ngs needed like wpn client they should be thre already or you should an oboarding page where is described what you need to do and a contact in case you need help.

The support is really important :)
