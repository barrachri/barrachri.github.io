This is a curated list of resources that helped me starting my consulting career.

It covers what consulting is about, why freelancing and consulting are not the same thing, marketing, positioning, how to tame that good amount of self-doubt that you'll have. 

And highlight a few skills that you have to nurture: coaching, and leadership.

Whether you are a software developer, data scientist, or product owner, that wants to switch, you'll find these resources useful.
