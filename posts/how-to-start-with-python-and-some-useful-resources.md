**Python is an awesome language, simple, explicit, readable and powerful.**

I spent a lot of time wondering about how to start learning Python, which resources use and what books I should buy.

After this and some money spent on books I want to share my experience:

First of all there’s a lot of free resources so I think it is not useful to invest too much money on books or other things.

#To start
There's a lot of interesting Python online courses, they don't talk about every aspect of Python but they are a good starting point.

**Remember to start with Python 3 !**  

###Online courses
- [Codecademy Python Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python "Codecademy Python Track") - Very useful, with a few hours of practice you can begin mastering the Python basics.
- [Learnpython.org](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ "Learnpython.org") - Another interesting online course
- [Learn Python the hardway](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book "Learn Python the hardway") - If you prefer the "hardway" both course/book.

So pick up one of this course and start learning Python.

###Books

If you prefer some good books I think this is the best to start.

- [Learning Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028154.do "Learning Python") - Awesome book, it talks deeply about every aspect of Python and sometimes it’s a little “boring”. But, personally, I can call it the Python Bible.
This book costs a lot of money and it's worth it, but often you'll find interesting offer (50 % discount) on O'Reilly site.

#Useful resource

###Video

- [Pyvideo](http://pyvideo.org/ "Pyvideo") - A collection of PyCon talks

###Books

- [Officiale Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/ "Officiale Python Docs") - save it in your bookmarks, it's your reference about Python.
- [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do "Python for Data Analysis") - Awesome book about Numpy and Scipy is in my to-read-list.
- [Mining the Social Web](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030195.do "Mining the Social Web") - Great book about data mining, another must read book.
- [Building Machine Learning Systems with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781782161400.do "Building Machine Learning Systems with Python") - If you want to start with ML this is the right book for you.
- [Python Pocket Reference](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028338.do "Python Pocket Reference") -It's a good pocket reference, if you can get it for 5 bucks it's a best buy.
- [Test-Driven Development with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029533.do "Test-Driven Development with Python") - I've read some pages, interesting but I recommend from an intermediate level.

Same as for "Learning Python", these books cost a lot of money, but you can get them with some good discount on O'Really site.

### Slides
- [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/ "Slideshare.com")
- [Speackerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/ "Speackerdeck.com")

### Events and Conferences
Go to [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/ "Meetup.com") and look for a Python meetup in your city and most of all take a ticket for the next PyCon in your country.
This is my first year that I’ve participated in PyCon Italy and DjangoVillage and it was a great experience which left me wondering why I have not gone before.

# Mistakes to avoid
Don’t make my mistake to buy a lot of interesting long books about Python when you're not started to code yet.

Remember, reading docs and books is important but code is much more important !
So after studying function, generators, class and others remember to write some code to see if you understood what you have studied.

It's time to code now !
