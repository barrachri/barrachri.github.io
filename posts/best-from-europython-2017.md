So [__EuroPython 2017__](https://ep2017.europython.eu) is over!

It's been a tough mission to organize the #EuroPython this year but again it was an amazing experience.

A special thank goes to all the people that have participated in organizing the conference: [EuroPython Team](https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/europython/team/).

This is my _to-watch-list_ for __EuroPython 2017__, probably you can end up with something different, in case you wonder talks are randomly ordered.

# 1) [The encounter: Python's adventures in Africa](https://ep2017.europython.eu/conference/talks/the-encounter-pythons-adventures-in-africa) // Aisha Bello & Daniela Procida // [Slide](https://ep2017.europython.eu/media/conference/slides/the-encounter-pythons-adventures-in-africa.pdf)

I've met [Aisha](https://twitter.com/AishaXBello) for the first time during [EuroPython 2015](ep2015.europython.eu), she was an attendee of the DjangoGirls workshop in Bilbao.

From that moment she has put a [lot of effort](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2016/dec/22/dsf-announces-winner-2016-malcolm-tredinnick-memor/) in growing the Python community in Africa and the results are astonishing as much as the different kind of problems they are facing there.

# 2) [PyBind11 - seamless operability between C++11 and Python](https://ep2017.europython.eu/conference/talks/pybind11-seamless-operability-between-c11-and-python) // Ivan Smirnov // [Slide](https://ep2017.europython.eu/media/conference/slides/pybind11-seamless-operability-between-c11-and-python.pdf)

Python is getting faster, directly or through new projects like [PyBind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11).
It's impressive how easily you can bind Python and C++, kudos to the creators and maintainers.

# 3) [A Python for future generations](https://ep2017.europython.eu/conference/talks/a-python-for-future-generations) // A. Ronacherr // [Slide](https://ep2017.europython.eu/media/conference/slides/a-python-for-future-generations.pdf)

Armin's view about what Python should be in the future and where we should put our efforts to improve Python. I personally agree with what he thinks about breaking compatibilities.

# 4) [Deep Learning your broadband network @home](https://ep2017.europython.eu/conference/talks/deep-learning-your-broadband-network-home) // Hongjoo Lee // [Slide](https://ep2017.europython.eu/media/conference/slides/deep-learning-your-broadband-network-home.pdf)

Very interesting talk, an "hand-made" data science project, from getting the data to analyzing them.

Inspiring presentation about the current state of software development inside academy and research and how it should be (and hopefully will be).

# 6) [Abstract base classes a smart use of metaclasses](https://ep2017.europython.eu/conference/talks/abstract-base-classes-a-smart-use-of-metaclasses) // Leonardo Giordano // [Slide](https://ep2017.europython.eu/media/conference/slides/abstract-base-classes-a-smart-use-of-metaclasses.pdf)

Scare your children with meta-classes!
A lot of Python programmers are scared by the word `Meta-classes`, this presentation will make your life easier, beautiful introduction to meta-classes and ABC.

# 7) [How to create inspiring data visualizations?](https://ep2017.europython.eu/conference/talks/how-to-create-inspiring-data-visualizations) // Jan Willem Tulp

Do you know how many trees there are world? That's a lot of data points to visualize.

# 9) [A faster Python? you have these choices](https://ep2017.europython.eu/conference/talks/a-faster-python-you-have-these-choices) // Paul Ross // [Slide](https://ep2017.europython.eu/media/conference/slides/a-faster-python-you-have-these-choices.pdf)
A very interesting presentation about how to make your Python code faster but it faces the problem from a chief/lead role perspective instead of how effectively write faster code.

If you are facing these problems inside your team this presentation is for you.

This was a lightning talk during the last day of the conference (LTs are not online yet).

The story is quiet interesting and there is also a [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/new-pants-for-europython-2018--2#/) &#x1F923;.


But there is a lot more to come (I think more than 200 sessions), soon we are going to release all the program on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC98CzaYuFNAA_gOINFB0e4Q)!
