      <description>So EuroPython 2017 is over!
It&amp;rsquo;s been a tough mission to organize the #EuroPython this year but again it was an amazing experience.
A special thank goes to all the people that have participated in organizing the conference: EuroPython Team.
This is my to-watch-list for EuroPython 2017, probably you can end up with something different, in case you wonder talks are randomly ordered.
1) The encounter: Python&amp;rsquo;s adventures in Africa // Slide I&amp;rsquo;ve met Aisha for the first time during EuroPython 2015, she was an attendee of the DjangoGirls workshop in Bilbao.</description>
