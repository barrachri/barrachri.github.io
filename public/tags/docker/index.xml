      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made a blog post about Docker some months ago.
During this time a lot of things changed.
The last version of Docker is 1.5.0-rc4 and Fig project is now docker-compose.
I&amp;rsquo;ve tried docker-compose and I think there have been huge improvements in containers orchestration.
Now you can manage simple or complex containers architecture with only a few lines of code.
The only limitation is that containers need to be on the same host.</description>
